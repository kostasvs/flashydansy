# Flashy Dansy
A minigame where you cause chaos dancing on a busy highway.

## About
Originally made for [#tagjam15](http://jams.gamejolt.io/tagjam15) gamejam (Oct 2014) in 3 days, later expanded with some new features and fixes.

Flashy Dansy was the winner of the gamejam and since then has over 18k downloads [on Gamejolt](http://gamejolt.com/games/platformer/flashy-dansy/35525/).

The project is now open source, mostly as a portfolio piece, but any contributions are welcome (see below).

## Usage

Made with Unity 2019.2. Upon cloning, you should be able to run immediately in Unity test mode, or build and run.

For mobile, the game should autodetect the platform and enable the mobile UI (virtual D-Pad). To manually enable it, enable `MobileGame` in Player component (or manually set `Player.onMobile` to true via script).
